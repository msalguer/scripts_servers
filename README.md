# scripts_servers
MIT License. Manuel Salguero

Set of scripts in Bash shell for basic installations of Apache2, PHP (PHP 7 or default distribution versions), Nginx/PHP-FPM, MySQL 5 or 8 version, Wordpress and Moodle, with HTTPS self-signed certificate.

The system under which it has been tested has been Ubuntu 20.04

The scripts do not claim to be perfect, although under certain conditions with a clean server they are tested. They are intended to be a guide to the set of instructions to execute for each installation.

They also contain some sample configuration files for more complex installations, such as Nginx with PHP-FPM working with SSL. For openssl to support TLS 1.3, it should be upgraded to another version.

In some cases, the installation is built from some parts of another of the scripts.

Use them at your own risk.
